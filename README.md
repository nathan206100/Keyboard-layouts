# Keyboard-layouts
Personal repository for keeping record of alterations of different keymaps.
This is intended to hold my latest layout that I am currently running at any point in time.
Individual keyboard files will be grouped to a respective folder, to eliminate hardware revision issues and bundle any required files for builds.
